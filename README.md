#LayoverConnect
###Connecting People With Connecting Flights

LayoverConnect is a social application built for improving the traveling experience by connecting users during a layover.

This app was inspired during the Tnooz tHackSFO hackathon 2015. Using the SFO API we constructed a app for users who have a time to spend at the airport and will connect other travelers with the same time slot available.  Traveling can be a grueling experience and we hope this app can help bring great memories and networking through the layover experience.  No one likes a long layover without leaving the airport.  We hope this can be a solution.
